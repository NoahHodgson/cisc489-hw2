# Homework / Assignment 2



## Part 1

Copied the code per the instructions. I didn't run into issues once I commented out the code that made it run
for too long. Even on my midtier laptop that one function made it heat up. The rest of it ran fine. I had already
used NLTK for the first assignment, so this was mostly review for me. It was cool to learn about the universal
POS tagset though. 

## Part 2 

For my test set that I brought in, I did the first page of the Hobbit. I didn't need to tweak much. I did have to add
besides change an index that was starting at 1 instead of 0. Just going to blame my local data-scientists on that.
The text analyzed in the expected way. It was pain-free.

## Part 3 
Trying to decypher the Viterbi problem made me feel out of my depth.So I did what I always do and 
read some documentations and tutorials. [This](https://www.pythonpool.com/viterbi-algorithm-python/)
was the most helpful. I based my code mostly on this. I was unable to get the transmission output I desired
unfortunately, but I did come really close. I was getting Hot Cold Hot Cold Hot Hot or 
Hot Cold Hot Hot Cold Hot. Those are the right amount of Hots and Cold and the transitions are happening on
the 2s, just not the right two (last one). I am sure if I had a bit more time to tinker with the values I could
figure this out, but I am pretty happy with how this turned out.
